# WM800-Update-Tool
Winner Micro W800 Update Tool replacement for microcontroller software download.

This is a replacement for the WinnerMicro W800/W600 based boards "Upgrade_Tools_V1.4.18.exe", which is available only in chinese.

This software, as opposite to the original, is open and modifiable, and, most valuable, **it don't try to connect to any external server** when starts to run.

The actual is the first release, tested only on W800 for now.

The sources can be recompiled using the PellesC free compiler. The IDE project files are included.

Easy to move to MSVC (maybe I'll add MSVC project someday...).
